Kokkos::Cuda::initialize WARNING: Cuda is allocating into UVMSpace by default
                                  without setting CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
                                  The code must call Cuda::fence() after each kernel
                                  or will likely crash when accessing data on the host.
Kokkos::Cuda::initialize WARNING: Cuda is allocating into UVMSpace by default
                                  without setting CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC=1 or 
                                  setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.
                                  This could on multi GPU systems lead to severe performance
                                  penalties.
